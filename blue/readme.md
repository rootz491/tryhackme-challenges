    exploit name :

        exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

    search for MS-17-010 and read about eternal blue exploit related to SMBv1.0

    Start metasploit and search for same exploit

    exploit the machine

    check for easy process to take over in target machine (winlogon.exe)

    migrate process into it

    find non-default user : JON  | via hashdump

    copy password hash and crack it | via crackstation.net :  alqfna22

    now, just go for flag.txt (1,2 & 3)
